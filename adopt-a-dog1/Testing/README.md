Sally
She is 18 and a recent high school graduate. She is single and has moved out of her parent's place and into an apartment with roommates. She recently started a job in sales at a marketing firm.

Sally sharply represents the demographic of the younger generation; she specifically represents recent graduates of high school or college. She is decently tech savvy and will often be using her phone in her free time. She just started a full time job and uses a computer, but as a new hire may not have the time to browse while on the clock. She has a laptop that she rarely uses at home, as most things that she needs to do will be available on her phone. When browsing sites she uses Google Chrome on both her computers and smart phone. Her goal of using this site will be to find a companion as she is moving out on her own for the first time. She has roommates in her new apartment and will have to keep that in mind when making decisions.
