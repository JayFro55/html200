Sally
She is 18 and a recent high school graduate. She is single and has moved out of her parent's place and into an apartment with roommates. She recently started a job in sales at a marketing firm.

Sally sharply represents the demographic of the younger generation. She specifically represents recent graduates of high school or college. She is decently tech savvy and will often be using her phone in her free time. She just started a full time job and uses a computer, but as a new hire may not have the time to browse while on the clock. She has a laptop that she rarely uses at home. Most things that she needs to do will be available on her phone. When browsing sites she uses Google Chrome on both her computers and smart phone. Her goal of using this site will be to find a companion as she is moving out on her own for the first time. She has roommates in her new apartment and will have to keep that in mind when making decisions.

John is an Apple fanatic. His entire family has iPhones and Macs. He also uses a Mac at work. The only browser he uses is Safari. He does not own any tablets. He considers himself to be pretty technologically knowledgable, but only with Apple products. At home he uses his Mac and his phone almost an equal amount. 

Testing
Site was tested on browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. The site was tested using Chrome when coded.
There were not many noticeable differences between Chrome and Edge displays of the website. The footer has different heights. The responsiveness of the site on both browsers also seem nearly identical when going through browser size changes. When opened using Safari on a Mac the website seemed normal although there were slight discrepancies in the header width and footer height. When opened using Chrome on a Galaxy S8 phone the list of dogs properly shrank to 1 column, but the header and footer do not cover the entire width of the screen.

Changes
The header and footer were not reaching the edges of the device screen. Width for both header and footer were changed to 100% within the mobile media query.
